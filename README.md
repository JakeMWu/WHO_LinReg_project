# WHO_LinReg_project
 This is a linear regression project to predict life expectancy based on WHO data. The project was accomplished as part of a team while training at Digital Futures.
 
 This project contains three main files. 
 
 1. The Model_Creation file which contains the cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature selection and ultimately model training on the data.
 2. The Expectancy_Prediction_Model which contains a function (or functions) that allow for predictions on novel inputs. The prediction is self-contained for ease of use.
 3. The prediction model script which was used to deploy the model via streamlit https://wholifeexpectancy.streamlit.app/
