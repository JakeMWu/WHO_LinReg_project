# WHO_LinReg_project
 This is a linear regression project on life expecancy based on WHO data. This project contains two main files. The first is the Model_Creation file which contains the cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, feature selection and ultimately model training on the data. The second is the Expectancy_Prediction_Model which contains a function (or functions) that allow for predictions on novel inputs. The prediction is self-contained for ease of use. The project was accomplished as part of a team while training at Digital Futures.
